# MusicReview_Mining
Music review mining project for AI and text mining class (SCI6203)

In UGC dataset; only reviews exceeding 350 tokens were retained for comparability. All metadata fields were cleaned and normalized, and Unix timestamps were converted to MM/DD/YYYY. The reviewer_id in the non-professional dataset has been kept for now and will later be replaced when we turn the dataset int train/test splits. It will require class annotation for train set only.
